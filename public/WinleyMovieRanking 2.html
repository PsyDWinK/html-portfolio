 <h1>The Best Movies According to Winley</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>1. The Six Triple Eight</h3>

    <p>One of favorite movie of all-time is The Six Triple Eight. 
        This documentary tells the story of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, 
        the only Women's Army Corps unit of color.</p>

    <h3>2. Soul Men</h3>

    <p>Another favorite movie of mine is Soul Men. Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson
        are hilarious together in this movie. This was the last movie Bernie Mac starred
        in before passing away.</p>

    <h3>3. Black Panther</h3> 

    <p>Black Panther is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie is about T'Challa, 
        heir to the hidden but advanced kingdom of Wakanda. I feel this movie illustrates the
        impact of colonization and racial dynamics across the diaspora.</p>
